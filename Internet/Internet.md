**Use:** Allows computers and people to communicate, share information, and access services.

# 🖥️ Server

A **server** is a powerful computer that stores websites, apps, or data and responds to client requests.

- It is always connected to the internet.
- Each server has a **unique IP address** to be identified on the internet.

# 🔢 IP (Internet Protocol)

An **IP address** is like a unique home address for each device on the internet.

- It helps devices find and communicate with each other.

# 📡 Router

A **router** is like a **bus stop** that guides data to its destination.

- When you send a picture or information, it is broken into **small packets**.
- Each packet travels through **10–15 routers** before reaching the final destination.

### 📦 Packet Flow:
1. Send Data → Break into Small Packets  
2. Reach Router → Add Layer (info like source/destination)  
3. Next Router → Add Layer  
4. ... until it reaches the **Server**  
5. Response from Server → Same process back to the **Client**

# 🌐 What is HTTP?

**HTTP** stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**.

- It is the **foundation of data communication** on the web.
- HTTP defines how messages are **formatted and transmitted**, and how web **servers and browsers** should respond to commands.
- When you enter a website in your browser, it sends an **HTTP request** to the server.

# 🌍 What is DNS?

**DNS** stands for **Domain Name System**.

- It works like a **phonebook** of the internet.
- When you type a domain like `www.google.com`, DNS **translates it to an IP address** like `142.250.64.78`.
- This allows your browser to **find the correct server**.
